Written By Duran Keefe and Nde Mbah


Title of your project: Climate Closet
# Climate Closet: Weather-Based Outfit Recommender

Description of your project: 
Climate Closet solves a simple everyday problem: this probelm is standing in front of your closet
and not knowing what to wear due to the fact that you're unsure or uncertain about what the weather may hold for the day. A lot of indivduals check the weather,
but will still will not know or have uncertaintaty about how that should translate over to an actual outfit. Instead of guessing or flipping a coin or even overdressing, this app
makes sure to check and scan for the current weather for your location and turns that information into a clear clothing suggestion that makes sense for the temperature outside.

Our app displays and showcases a quick weather snapshot that includes the current temperature, humidity, and even wind speed so that way
users can see exactly what's going on outside. Based on the temperature data, the Climate Closet recommends what type of clothing to wear, such as a light shirt, long sleeves,
or a jacket. It also includes simple charts that help users see how the weather changes over time. Overall, the ultimate endgame for this application is to make getting dressed easier,
faster/more convient, and less stressful by using real, up to date weather data instead of guesswork.


Target browsers:
Tested and support IOS 18.6.2, and  Windows.

Link to Developer Manual

# Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md):
The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.

Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted
Documentation should be included in each team’s final code submission.
Documentation should be saved in your main project directory under "docs"
