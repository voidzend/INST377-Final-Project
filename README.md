Link to Developer Manual

# Developer Manual (bottom half of your README.md):
The audience of this document is future developers who will take over your system.
They know technical terms and have general knowledge about web applications, but do not have knowledge about your system design.
You need to provide a technical document so that future developers can start setting up the application on their local machines, and keep working on the system development after you leave the team.

Your Developer Manual covers:
How to install your application and all dependencies
How to run your application on a server
How to run any tests you have written for your software
The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PATCH, etc endpoints, and what they each do
A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.
Documentation needs to be written in Markdown (MD) files, nicely formatted
Documentation should be included in each team’s final code submission.
Documentation should be saved in your main project directory under "docs"
